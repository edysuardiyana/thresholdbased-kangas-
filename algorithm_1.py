#this is source code for algorithm 1
#IMPACT+POSTURE
# * use 0.1 s non-overlapped sliding window
# * calculate maximum value of SV_tot and SV_d and calculate the difference between SV_tot_max and sv_tot_min
# * compare the values above to the thresholdbased
# * if vals > thresholds, collect data after 2s from Z and use low filter for that data
# * collect 0.4s samples from above
# * calculate the averages from data above
# * if the average <= 0.5 then the posture is lying
